          <p> <span class="term 24 0">Hatsune Miku <span class="num">0</span></span> is by nature contradictory. Her <span class="term 95 1">Vocaloid <span class="num">1</span></span> software has gone through great lengths to create a technology that mimics a natural human voice. Her model too, used in live shows and official music videos, evokes the mass and mobility of a life-sized teenage girl. At the same time, her skin lacks texture, her mouth is impossibly small, and she is eternally young. As Daniel Black writes, the virtual idol represents a “fantasy of the body as a pure, impermeable exteriority, into which nothing may be drawn and from which nothing may emanate.”<span class="cit 1">I</span> Miku has no guts, no organs, no blood, and she does not age; as a smooth and seamless surface, she is free from the unruliness of biology that might make her unpure or dirtied. This fantasy of the body is one in which there are no surprises, where “it quite clearly has ‘nothing to hide.’”<span class="cit 2">II</span></p>

          <p> Beyond these physical characteristics, Miku’s image becomes vastly more complex. As a vessel for human affect, she is not only subject to but a product of the porous relational network of fan-created media. Fans become both consumers and creators of Miku’s image, blurring the distinction between Miku as an independent entity and the fans that project their fantasies onto her. Nowhere is this tension between Miku’s digital seamlessness and her messy interrelational underpinnings more visible than in the physical embodiment fans of Miku herself through <span class="term 11 2">cosplay <span class="num">2</span></span>. The cosplay is an attempt to recreate the two-dimensional character in real life, not just visually, but also through their mannerisms. Cosplayers may imitate the poses of characters and repeat popular catch phrases to generally emulate the character’s “aura.”<span class="cit 3">III</span> As a result, the cosplay comes to occupy a “liminal existence between fantasy and reality” that straddles the digital and the material.</p>

      			<img src="assets/scan_2.png" class="imgFormat">
      			<div class="imgCaption">The first photogrammetry scan I attempted had large gaps where I was wearing black fabric. My legs were almost entirely missing.</div>
      		</div>


          <h2> Becoming Hatsune Miku </h2>
          <p> I am fascinated by this contradiction between Miku’s flattened virtual image and the human affective labor that powers it. I explore this contradiction at the site of the hybrid virtual body through a cheap, ready-made Hatsune Miku costume and wig. Cosplays can range wildly in execution, with ones that most closely emulate the character generally requiring more custom building and craftsmanship. These cosplays often involve an excruciating level of detail that most closely attempts to translate the seamless fantasy form into real life. On the other end of the spectrum, the casual cosplay is full of seams that reveal the discrepancies of the digital character in human form. These often take shape in ill-fitting costumes (often a product of ready-made garments), unstyled wigs, and amateur technique. </p>

          <p>This scruffy translation of the virtual character on the physical body is brought back to the virtual through several full-body 3D scans of myself in the cosplay. I used photogrammetry technology through Agisoft Metashape to construct this model through photos taken by a friend through my phone camera. The software did well to capture my general form but struggled with some more of the detailed areas—the black fabric in Miku’s costume around the forearms, skirts, and stockings rendered questionably, if at all (this is a known weakness of photogrammetry software); and random visual artifacts attached itself to the model in ambiguous globs. The software also left a rough, lumpy texture throughout the surface of the model that seemed to emphasize the materiality of the scan and its subsequent unruliness.</p>

          <div class="imgContainer">
      			<img src="assets/figure_5.png" class="imgFormat">
      			<div class="imgCaption">The Artist Masterpiece Plus Figure Hatsune Miku: Birthday 2023 Ver.</div>
      		</div>

          <p>In addition to cosplay, collectable <span class="term 6 3">anime figures <span class="num">3</span></span> are popular within anime, video game, and adjacent spaces as real-life statues of fictional characters. These figures are typically at a smaller-than-life scale, contain a high level of detail, and come in various poses that, similar to cosplay, attempt to translate the aura of a character into material form. Miku alone has hundreds of figures where she is depicted in a variety of costumes, hairstyles, and dynamic poses that can get incredibly detailed and complex. </p>

          <p>Following the language of these anime figures, I retranslated my 3D scan back into the material by 3D-printing it as a 1:6 scale figure with gray PLA. The figure itself stands stiffly with both arms out at a 45 degree angle—due to the limitations of my photogrammetry technique, this pose was one of the only ones I could hold long enough to ensure an effective scan. The resulting statue refuses the smooth, pristine appearance of typical anime figurines with its excessively bumpy surface and unarticulated, bulbous forms. The contours of my body have been melted away into masses of visual detritus that become especially formless in the areas I donned black fabric, where the photogrammetry software struggled to read me. </p>

          <p>These imperfect translations generate a form increasingly populated by digital and material noise. As a <span class="ital">moe</span> character, Miku’s image is one that always returns to the body. As she travels between her virtual representations and the outside associations channeled into her image by fans, the purity of her original image is ruptured by the hybridity of her crowd-sourced form. She is at once disembodied and embodied—an abstract, two-dimensional image free of biology, and a network of affective experience. My imitation of her hybrid image highlights this contradiction central to her image.</p>

          <h2>The Website</h2>
          <p> The website serves a digital thesis book for my degree project and comes with a physical print component an accompanying 3D-printed figure. I use the scan of my body in cosplay as the navigation system for the website, flipping the body metaphors in HTML tags back onto the human figure. Each section of the body corresponds with a different area of my process: the central essay of my research is the torso (&lt;BODY&gt;), the interviews I conducted are the arm appendages (&lt;ARM_LEFT&gt; and &lt;ARM_RIGHT&gt;), the index of glossary terms and references are the legs and feet (&lt;FOOTER&gt;), and the meta of it is the head (&lt;HEAD&gt;). The print version of the website similarly separates these sections into individual books, with each book containing an insert of a life-size fold-out print of the associated body part. The books are housed in an acrylic plexiglass book case with a custom hole structure on the front to hold the 3D-printed figure.</p>

          <p>The glossary system is an essential part of this website. Much of the site’s content is full of references that reflect the network of information and knowledge inherent to the Vocaloid community. All relevant terminology throughout the text (highlighted in blue) can be clicked to reveal a short description that is added to the Playlist on the left hand side, along with a number denoting the order of its appearance in the text. You can choose to add whichever and however many terms to your Playlist as you like and send them to yourself for later reference. The &lt;FOOTER&gt; page compiles every term as well as their appearances throughout the site for reference.</p>

          	<p class="ital">How do I learn more about Vocaloid?</p>
          	<li>There is truly an incredible amount of Vocaloid content out there that can initially be daunting to tackle. My recommendation is to find a few songs that you like and see what else the producers of those songs have created. Each producer has their own songwriting style and way of tuning the Vocaloid that you may find yourself partial to. This spreadsheet is an excessively comprehensive fan-made list of some of Vocaloid’s most important songs that you can pick through. You can also start from some of the recommendations I’ve left below.</li>

          <h1>Becoming Hatsune Miku</h1>
          <sub>Posthuman Hybrid Identity, Virtual Biology, and Disobedient Consumption in the Vocaloid Community</sub>
          <span style="width: 0px; height: 468px; display: block"></span>

          <p> At the end of the day, I have trouble explaining why I have returned to Hatsune Miku time and time again. <span class="term 68 19 ital">&#9835; Reboot <span class="num">19</span></span> by <span class="term 34 20">JimmyThumbP <span class="num">20</span></span> was the first song to recruit me at eleven years old—it had a striking coming- of-age story with a fully animated music video that played like a short film. I definitely cried the first time I watched it. I fell back in love with Vocaloid again in high school, where I had (and still have) on my iTunes eight different versions of <span class="term 15 21">DECO*27's <span class="num">21</span></span> <span class="term 18 22 ital"> &#9835; Ghost Rule <span class="num">22</span></span>. I would spend hours poring over YouTube videos with no more than a few thousand views each, alone but cozy in this small corner of the internet. Six years later, within twenty-four hours of landing in Tokyo for the first time, I was on the bullet train some 200+ miles West of Osaka to celebrate Miku’s sixteenth birthday. I watched from the far back corner of a warehouse amongst thousands of fans as a life-sized hologram of a teal-haired anime girl materialized onto stage and began to sing. I sat so far back that Miku was only a blurry figure in my line of vision—much more visible to me was the sea of colored glow sticks that the fans waved to the beat in uncanny unison. This array of lights rose and fell like a singular breathing organism as the crowd chanted select lyrics in one thundering voice. Each song was transformed through this chorus of fans as I reexperienced Miku’s music again for the first time. </p>

          <p>That was the first time I had witnessed the Vocaloid community as a physical, embodied presence that overwhelmed a space through sheer mass alone. Growing up Chinese-American in the United States, my interest in East Asian popular media was a lonely one. What I found refreshing about <span class="term 5 23">anime <span class="num">23</span></span> came off as strange and pointless to my American peers. I learned to find camaraderie online through forums and YouTube, where Vocaloid naturally lived and blossomed, and I discovered Miku in turn. This time, however, my Americanness was the barrier, as the community thrived most in East Asian circles while the English-speaking community was small and outdated. I won’t belabor the loneliness of a third-culture upbringing, which can surely become an exhausted narrative at times, but I do believe it made finding solace in unfamiliar spaces a survival skill. It’s unsurprising then that I found Miku herself as a companion.</p>


          <h2>Introduction </h2>
          <p> Hatsune Miku was created in 2007 by <span class="term 12 24">Crypton Future Media Inc.  <span class="num">24</span></span> as a Vocaloid, a digital voice synthesizer software that allows users to create artificial singing voices. She represents the voice bank of actress Saki Fujita through the image of a twin tailed 16-year-old virtual idol. Miku’s age is one of only a handful of parameters initially specified about her— the rest of her character, including her background, personality, motivations, etc. are decided by fans through Vocaloid’s unique crowd-sourced model. In other words, fans are the creators of Miku’s 100,000+ songs and 1,000,000 artworks, and have full reign to interpret her image however they want. This network of fan-produced media is at the core of Miku’s popularity and is made possible by Crypton’s custom PiaPro copyright laws, which allow free usage of Miku’s character as long as the user does not profit from it. <span class="cit 1">I</span> While this allows for a creative space relatively untainted by economic incentive, the reality is that the vast majority of fans do not make any money from their creations while Miku herself generates millions in revenue. Such policies enable Crypton to use Miku to secure corporate partnerships with companies like Dominoes Pizza, Toyota, and Google while the labor of developing Miku’s image is outsourced to fans.</p>

      			<div class="imgCaption">Hatsune Miku’s V2 box art</div>
      		</div>


          <p>It is no mistake either that Miku’s flexible identity is grounded first and foremost in the image of a cute teenage girl, a reflection of <span class="term 54 26 ital">moe <span class="num">26</span></span> aesthetics and marketing power. Patrick W. Gailbraith describes moe as “a euphoric response to fantasy characters” that, while not always the case, often consist of “youthful, innocent girls.”<span class="cit 2">II</span> Characters classified as moe represent a “pure” ideal that is “unpolluted” by reality—they are flattened, two-dimensional surfaces that allow for the elaboration of fantastical desires and virtual possibilities. At the same time, they are passive images that allow for an ideal of femininity that is unthreatening, vulnerable, and devoid of the grossness of flesh. There is ample discussion out there on the gender issues reflected through the moe form as well as the tendency for outside audiences, especially in Western spheres, to overrepresent the most extreme perversions of what is often a platonic desire.<span class="cit 3">III</span> I am more interested here in exploring how Miku’s particular existence as a virtual, malleable form has the ability to subvert the relationships of power that govern her moe image while inspiring similar potential in the lives of her fans and users. Although inevitably subject to the commercial interests of the music industry, Miku’s crowd-sourced model allows fans to project their own desires onto fluid virtual images like Miku. Thus, Miku becomes a digital proxy through which fans can elaborate playful fantasies beyond their own bodily capacities. This creates a space of narrative possibility that overcomes the anxieties of an embodied identity, and in which fans can begin to reimagine their own relationship to hierarchies of control.</p>


          <h2>Writing Hybridity Onto the “Blank Page”</h2>
          <p>Miku’s success traces back to her origins in a community-based culture. Vocaloid software does not require knowledge of sheet music, allowing anyone to create a functional melody within the user interface in minutes. Vocaloid music’s primary sharing platform <span class="term 58 27">Niconico <span class="num">27</span></span> functions similar to Youtube in that anyone can create an account, upload videos, and comment. As a result, amateur producers are behind many of Miku’s most popular tracks. Miku’s success also stems from her incredibly diverse range of music. Even if <span class="term 12 28">Crypton <span class="num">28</span></span> primarily intended Miku to sing pop,<span class="cit 4">IV</span> many Miku songs fall outside of the genre and push narrative convention. As a character, Miku’s personality ranges from a self-centered brat who considers herself a “princess” in <span class="term 99 29 ital">&#9835; World is Mine <span class="num">29</span></span> to a meek, pure-hearted girl in love in <span class="term 50 30 ital">&#9835; Melt <span class="num">30</span></span>. She appears in a variety of settings, from the Westernization of Japan during the Meiji Restoration in <span class="term 75 31 ital">&#9835; Senbonzakura <span class="num">31</span></span> to the computer where she is installed in <span class="term 85 32 ital">&#9835; The Disappearance of Hatsune Miku -DEAD END- <span class="num">32</span></span> . Miku also sings everything from heavy metal in <span class="term 55 33 ital">&#9835; Mukuro Attack <span class="num">33</span></span> to opera in the experimental Vocaloid production <span class="term 86 34 ital">&#9835; THE END <span class="num">34</span></span>. Her flexibility as a “blank page,” as described by Crypton’s CEO Itoh Hiroyuki,<span class="cit 5">V</span> is the source of her popularity as creators impose their own interpretations onto her as a character, voice, and piece of software.</p>

					<p>As a virtual figure, Miku creates meaning through the flatness of her moe form, which creates space for the elaboration of fantasy. Kyle Davidson describes this as “an indication [she] is not ordinary life . . . but something extraordinary that allows for the possibility of higher orders of abstraction.” He continues:

          <p class="pull">The closer to reality a representation is, the less opportunity there is for a viewer to reinterpret the sign and create the play fantasy. There are holographic representations of real, albeit deceased, artists like Prince. The representation of Prince has a modality that is high, meaning the hologram is more indexical to its referent. The Hatsune Miku hologram, with a low modality, has a more symbolic relationship to a referent that is an abstract concept (an artificially intelligent, singing, android girl). Play creates a ‘figurative space instantiated by communicative interactions that semiotically shape the evolution of meaning among its participants as learning.’<span class="cit 6">VI</span> </p></p>

          <p>Miku’s virtual, two-dimensional character is the site of potential. Her lack of context creates a surface in which many fantasy forms can exist simultaneously— she is at once a spoiled princess and a shy schoolgirl, a revolutionary leader and a digital artifact. As Galbraith writes, the essence of <span class="term 54 35 ital">moe <span class="num">35</span></span> is “a response to the virtual possibilities of characters outside the bounds of reality.” But Miku is also unique from the typical moe form in that the consumers of her image also have a direct role of creating it—the fan-produced fantasy is made true through the lack of a given ‘truth’ to her character. As an embodiment of the narratives of her creators, Miku can thus serves as a digital proxy through which fans can elaborate playful fantasies beyond the capacity of their own bodily and social capabilities. For some, Miku gives a voice to their own sentiments. Popular producer <span class="term 83 36">syudou <span class="num">36</span></span> describes in an interview with <span class="term 12 37 ">Crypton <span class="num">37</span></span> how his breakthrough moment with <span class="term 32 38 ital">&#9835; Jama <span class="num">38</span></span> came from the realization that writing “cute songs, idol-type songs” to fit Miku’s “cute” voice did not resonate with the community. Rather, “if I was honest with myself, Hatsune Miku would come along with me.”<span class="cit 7">VII</span> For others, creating with Miku allows one to access the cultural capital of Miku’s character. When asked about his favorite Vocaloid in another interview with Crypton, producer <span class="term 67 39 ">r-906 <span class="num">39</span></span> names Miku, citing: “Hatsune Miku is a massive and universal culture that is already complete. Even people starting new, though, are able to take hold of this great power.”<span class="cit 8">VIII</span> By nature of her crowd-sourced foundation, Miku carries with her the affective traces of an entire collective of people—she is at once “ontological, shifting, multiple, and relational: not the core of the individual, but the engine of relation...”<span class="cit 9">IX</span> With Miku, creators like syudou begin to form “new hybrid identities” as “virtual cyborgs” built from an amalgamate of creator and creation.<span class="cit 10">X</span> Thus, one cannot conceptualize her independent from her community. Miku is as much of a reflection of her fans as her fans create, reflect, and are Miku themselves.</p>

          <p>Creators use Miku to explore a range of messages through their music. On one hand, they can be unapologetically playful—<span class="term 64 40 ital">&#9835; PoPiPo <span class="num">40</span></span> is a near-nonsensical yet wildly popular song about drinking vegetable juice: its absurd premise, repetitively catchy lyrics, and corresponding dance have spawned countless covers and memes that place it in the <span class="term 96 41">Vocaloid Hall of Legends <span class="num">41</span></span> (for songs exceeding 1,000,000 views on Niconico).<span class="cit 11">XI</span> By contrast, many other songs use Miku as a medium to discuss more serious themes. <span class="term 79 42 ital">&#9835; Slow Motion <span class="num">42</span></span> is an upbeat, cheerful song with a music video (MV) full of bright pastel colors—despite this, its lyrics reflect on a life of regret while grappling with the inevitably of death. In an interview with the creator of <span class="ital">Slow Motion</span>, <span class="term 62 43 ">Pinnochio-P <span class="num">43</span></span> describes his interest in Miku’s non-human nature as something with “expressive potential,” adding, “since I often write lyrics from an outside perspective, this really suits this kind of lyrics.” When the interviewer follows up with a question about Pinnochio-P’s often “cynical and pessimistic lyrics,”<span class="cit 12">XII</span> Pinnochio-P responds that his intention with such lyrics is not to be cynical merely for the sake of it, but rather to spark conversation on more serious topics that he finds “interesting” (<span class="ital">omoshiroi</span>).<span class="cit 13">XIII</span> The fact that many mainstream songs like <span class="ital">Slow Motion</span> deal with such darker subject matter behind energetic melodies may speak to the resonance of these themes among fans, such that they can exist plainly in a catchy, popular beat. To Pinocchio-P, Miku’s non-human nature offers a sort of neutrality that allows him to express more abstracted, “bird’s-eye” (<span class="ital">fukanshi</span>) claims as opposed to reflecting the personal emotions of an individual. This, as well as the sweeping popularity of Pinnochio-P’s works, suggests the earnest truth of many darker themes in popular Vocaloid tracks as well as Miku’s capacity to carry these cultural subtexts. When asked about using Miku as a form of expression, Pinnochio-P continues:

          <p class="pull"> If I had someone else sing, I would probably adjust things to suit them. I think this would put the brakes on the lyrics. So, I think it is really true that I would not have been able to express myself if VOCALOID did not exist.<span class="cit 14">XIV</span></p></p>

					<h2>Transcending Biology Through the Virtual Body</h2>
					<p>Many fans also find expression through the digital capabilities within the Vocaloid software itself. It is worth noting that <span class="term 12 44 ">Crypton <span class="num">44</span></span> officially specifies Miku’s preferred vocal range as A3–E5 and preferred tempo as 70–150 BPM,<span class="cit 15">XV</span> parameters not unsimilar to those of a skilled human vocalist. In stretching the Vocaloid software beyond these limits, one begins to find cracks in the technology through which glitches and imperfections offer moments of unpredictability that offer possible subversions to Miku’s original intended usage. <span class="term 85 45 ital">&#9835; The Disappearance of Hatsune Miku <span class="num">45</span></span> uses such glitches within Miku’s voicebank as digital artifacts to express the precarity of Miku’s virtual existence. In the same song, Miku sings as fast as 240 BPM, or around 12 syllables per second, exemplifying her inhuman capabilities. Many fans resist the pursuit of a more “human” sound and embrace Miku’s distinctly digital nature as part of her unique appeal, as is also true with Miku’s expansive range. In the song <span class="term 26 46 ital">&#9835; High Pitch Addicts Vocal Range Test <span class="num">46</span></span>, Miku’s software is pushed to sing as high as C7.<span class="cit 16">XVI</span> Her voice can also be tuned so low and adjusted in timbre within the Vocaloid software that it begins to take on masculine traits. This low-range Miku has spurred fans to create a “genderswap” persona <span class="term 25 47"> Hatsune Mikuo <span class="num">47</span></span> who endures as one of the most popular fan-made Vocaloids today.<span class="cit 17">XVII</span> Thus, Miku’s identity is not restricted to the high-pitched, feminine voice traditionally associated with her feminine presentation. She has the ability to transcend the image of a subordinate, docile symbol of girlhood. By containing a spectrum of masculine and feminine vocalizations, Miku challenges producers to think of gender outside of binary terms and instead as “a fluid process rather than an essential identity…one of any number of narrative possibilities that can be assembled.”<span class="cit 18">XVIII</span> Like clothing, hairstyle, or personality, gender becomes another malleable aspect of Miku that can be shaped beyond strict notions of “male” and “female.” This allows her to overcome marketable gender binaries enforced by the rules of the free market.</p>

					<div class="imgContainer">

      			<div class="imgCaption">Fan-made image of Hatsune Mikuo</div>
      		</div>

					<p>For fans, Miku’s flexible identity can help them create tangible alternatives to traditional expectations of gender within themselves. One prominent subculture within Vocaloid involves human vocalists who cover Vocaloid songs, or <span class="term 91 48 ital">utaite <span class="num">48</span></span>. These vocalists often challenge themselves to replicate the technical achievements of Vocaloid software through their own voices—one running joke within the community even ties an <span class="ital">utaite</span>’s popularity to their ability to hit high notes. Popular male <span class="ital">utaite</span> <span class="term 45 49">Mafumafu <span class="num">49</span></span> is known for his soft voice that often takes on feminine qualities with a range that rivals Miku’s. In his cover of <span class="term 4 50 ital">&#9835; Alien Alien <span class="num">50</span></span>, he successfully hits C7 in the final chorus. Mafumafu also produces and sings a number of original works including the widely discussed <span class="term 29 51 ital">&#9835; I Wanna Be a Girl <span class="num">51</span></span>, which has spawned interpretations ranging from a celebration of “girly” things to a personal coming-out.<span class="cit 19">XIX</span> <span class="term 1 52">96Neko <span class="num">52</span></span> is another popular female utaite known for her husky timbre that allows her to switch easily between convincing masculine and feminine voices. She will often display her versatility through duets with a male and female part, such as in her <span class="term 31 53 ital">&#9835; Ib <span class="num">53</span></span> cover of <span class="term 16 54 ital">&#9835; E? Aa, Sou. <span class="num">54</span></span>, where she sings both Mary and Garry’s parts herself. This type of style has become so popular within the utaite subculture that it has become its own category—<span class="term 71 55 ital">ryouseirui <span class="num">55</span></span> (lit. “both vocal types”) is a label to describe utaite who have the ability to sing with both masculine and feminine-sounding qualities. In this way, the fans themselves become new interpretations of Miku, creating a cycle of relation where fan and Miku mingle, intertwine, and combine. The result is a hybrid identity between human and machine that deprioritizes and transcends the materiality of the body.</p>

					<h2>Unproductive Consumption and the Voice of Resistance</h2>
					<p>After growing up around Miku’s music, I saw her perform live for the first time during <span class="term 46 56 ">Magical Mirai 2023 <span class="num">56</span></span> in Osaka. These concerts are large, high-energy events where a hologram of Miku is projected onto an invisible pane of glass onstage. This Miku alternates between singing and speaking directly to the audience while a live band performs as support to the side. Many concerts also come with an accompanying exhibition hall where fans can buy Miku-related merchandise from a variety of vendors, including <span class="term 6 57">anime figures <span class="num">57</span></span>, plushies, apparel, and other paraphernalia. These embodied experiences and physical collectibles serve as tangible manifestations of Miku’s abstract digital existence. And while these events provide moments of collective, in-person celebration, they also make increasingly clear the commercial interests that underpin Miku’s character.<span class="cit 20">XX</span> <span class="term 12 58">Crypton's <span class="num">58</span></span>  use of Miku builds from a “bottom-up fan production” model in which fans create music, participate in discussions, and enrich the community of Miku while Crypton maintains intellectual property rights over the character.<span class="cit 21">XXI</span> As such, many of the fans that engage and create with Miku do so out of their own passion and joy rather than any economic incentive. Some creators that get hired off of their fame even express regret toward tainting their own fan practice with money.<span class="cit 22">XXII</span> Having one’s music performed at large-scale concerts like Magical Mirai becomes an honorable form of recognition from Crypton. Fans are at once consumers and producers of the affective labor they channel into 	Miku—labor that is driven by personal desire and creativity. All of this reinforces Crypton’s ability to leverage Miku’s brand as a revenue generator while her image and subsequent popularity remain a product of the labor of fans. Perhaps nowhere best exemplifies these unequal motivations than in Miku’s ad collaborations. In one such <span class="term 20 59 ">ad for Google <span class="num">59</span></span>, a video celebrating the thousands of producers, artists, and fans in the Miku community segues into a promotion for Google Chrome as a way to “start your own web,” where the affective labor of these thousands of creators is at once condensed, neatly packaged, and resold back to them.<span class="cit 23">XXIII</span> </p>

					<p>Yet, by operating largely outside of economic incentive, these fans can also begin to reimagine their relationship to capitalism through refusal of notions of productive consumption. The term <span class="term 61 60 ital">otaku <span class="num">60</span></span>  describes fans of anime, game, and related subcultures like Vocaloid—it carries with it associations of perversely excessive interest, social reclusion, and general lack of “common sense.”<span class="cit 24">XXIV</span> A study by Thiam Huat Kam interviewed Japanese students on their reasoning behind judging certain people as <span class="ital">otaku</span>. He writes:

					<p class="pull"> The students I interviewed condemn as distasteful and unhealthy, and hence label as ‘otaku’, those people whom they perceive to be engaging in idle fantasy or possessing trivial knowledge – the forms of imagination and knowledge that are not productive of capital. On the other hand, the people these students do not label are precisely those whose imagination, knowledge and collection are productive: they are wage laborers (e.g., cosplayers who work as maids in maid cafes) or entrepreneurs (e.g., collectors who intend to make a profit from their collections).<span class="cit 25">XXV</span> </p></p>

					<p> Thus, financial motivations seem to dictate whether or not one’s interest is viewed as socially acceptable, implying that this interest could not reasonably be justified through any other means. Yet, because most fans of Miku engage without the intention of profit, they produce “nothing (but self satisfaction).”<span class="cit 26">XXVI</span> This has the potential to open a space where “imagination, knowledge, and desire” can instead be used to build alternative modes of thought that resist the logic of capitalism’s exploitation.<span class="cit 27">XXVII</span></p>

					<p> Within Japan, this exploitation manifests in part through the cultural taboo of discussing it in the first place. <span class="ital">Karoshi</span>, or “death-by-overwork,” describes the phenomenon of workers either dying from incurred health problems or committing suicide due to the stress of work. This is due to the intense social pressures of the workplace which strongly reward those who overextend themselves to take on additional work. Performance-based-pay is a common practice that normalizes “service overtime,” or overtime without pay, by adding a financial penalty to behavior perceived as self-centered or uncooperative.<span class="cit 28">XXVIII</span> As a result, workers are both financially and socially incentivized to prioritize the interests of the workplace over their personal wellbeing and subject themselves to exploitation. Despite this, many people are inhibited from seeking help due to a culture of shame where social reputation and appearance, rather than internal judgements, tend to drive behavior.<span class="cit 29">XXIX</span> This in turn fuels Japan’s strong conformist culture which discourages people from voicing opinions perceived as going against the norm. Because the Vocaloid space operates largely online, Miku is not subject to the same cultural taboos and social ramifications of speaking out. This allows creators to channel sentiments disobedient to capitalism through Miku while maintaining a certain distance from the anxieties of associating those sentiments with their real-world identity. At the same time, creators can realize these sentiments more easily through the psychological distance of disembodying them from themselves and attaching them to Miku. This metaphorical decapitation is made possible through the slipperiness of identity in virtual spaces and the capacity of these spaces for anonymity. Despite the range of musical genres within Vocaloid music, the prevalence of darker themes throughout songs that reflect some “hard truth” of contemporary social reality is undeniable, speaking to the power of Miku’s digital voice as an alternate avenue of expression independent from the claustrophobia of capitalism’s manifestations. </p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>At the time of writing this, I will have known Miku for a decade. I have changed throughout the years, but part of what has made Miku compelling to me is her ability to have grown with me—as the community evolves, so does her music, and I find through that a companion that is affected by the same world I live in and responds to it. This comes at a time when some of the producers I admired years ago have become increasingly watered down, trading musicality and passion for production deals. As Miku and her image become increasingly corporatized, alternative images like <span class="term 93 61">UTAU <span class="num">61</span></span> <span class="term 40 62">Kasane Teto <span class="num">62</span></span> have gained popularity for what Miku used to represent—Miku’s V4 voicebank costs hundreds of dollars while Teto’s voicebank has remained free. </p>

					<p>This is especially relevant now as Vocaloid’s global popularity wanes and its fanbase becomes more vulnerable to corporate interests—since Miku’s peak popularity in the early to mid 2010s, <span class="term 58 63">Niconico <span class="num">63</span></span> has slowly lost traffic to Youtube, and many famous Vocaloid producers have since moved on from the community. Within these new dynamics, the subversive power of Vocaloid’s participatory culture is ever more relevant as the internet becomes increasingly centralized. Figures like Miku, who are rooted in fan creation, have the potential to carry political implications as an expression of the people. Thus, one must look past Miku’s inevitable commercialization and interrogate how the unique relationship between creator and creation lends power to the idea of unproductive consumption. Doing so mobilizes virtual space as a site of resistance despite the ubiquity of capital within online communities, allowing Miku to transcend the limitations originally imposed upon her. </p>

          <h1>Growing Up with Miku</h1>
          <sub> A Conversation with Ryan Yan </sub>
      		<span style="width: 0px; height: 468px; display: block"></span>

      		<h2> Discovering the World of Vocaloid </h2>
      		<p class="speaker1"> Christine Wang: How did you first discover Vocaloid?</p>

      		<p class="speaker2"> Ryan Yan: I’m trying to remember right now. It was definitely on YouTube. I’m trying to remember a specific song. It might have been through some anime YouTubers at the time. They would make “Top 10 Vocaloid” song lists, like, “Top 10 Darkest Vocaloid Songs.” And then there would be like, “Top 50 Fastest Vocaloid Songs,” and I’d watch that. I vividly remember the song <span class="term 85 64 ital">&#9835; Disappearance of Hatsune Miku <span class="num">64</span></span> .</p>

      		<p class="speaker1"> CW: Yes! I love that song! </p>

      		<p class="speaker2"> RY: I would rewatch the music video for that. At that time, I was also really into watching those piano videos where the keys are coming down the screen and people are playing it. And there was a video like, “How to play Disappearance of Hatsune Miku on Piano, LEVEL: IMPOSSIBLE!” I think from there it just sent me into a rabbit hole.</p>

          <p class="speaker1"> Yeah, I remember those. It was always the “darkest” as well, like “Top 10 Darkest.” </p>

          <p class="speaker2"> RY: Like oooh, so edgy!</p>

          <p class="speaker1"> CW: Do you remember your first impression of Vocaloid? How old were you?</p>

          <p class="speaker2"> RY: It was middle school. I’m gonna say fifth grade, probably, was the beginning. I don’t know if I had a first impression. I just thought it was really cool. Right now, I feel like the impression would be like, “Oh, she’s not real... You’re listening to a robot voice,” but I feel like back then, I was so young; none of it mattered. I was just like, “This is a thing, and it’s cool.” I remember first discovering Miku and then seeing that there was this Vocaloid world where there were all these other people. I think what really got me hooked was when people would write narratives around these fictional characters, these singers, where it would seem like they were real characters. I think that’s when it got really interesting.</p>

          <p class="speaker1"> CW: What sorts of narratives?</p>

          <p class="speaker2"> RY: I remember this one song, something-Snow-White. She has her snow witch outfit, and she transforms into a bunch of other outfits. </p>

          <p class="speaker1"> CW: Oh, this one, <span class="term 80 65 ital">&#9835; The Snow White Princess Is <span class="num">65</span></span> ? This video from 10 years ago? </p>

          <div class="imgContainer">

      			</div>
      		</div>

          <p class="speaker2"> RY: Yeah. I remember I was reading the lyrics and people were like, “Oh my God, it’s so sad.” I don’t remember what she was singing about, but I was like, wow, she has real emotions. Yeah, I think seeing stuff like that. <span class="term 37 66 ">Rin <span class="num">66</span></span>  had a song, <span class="term 88 67 ital">&#9835; Tokyo Teddy Bear <span class="num">67</span></span> where she was a runaway child or something. And I was like, “Whoa, what? She’s so edgy!” as a kid or whatever. Just stuff like that.</p>

          <p class="speaker1"> CW: I love Tokyo Teddy Bear! And that producer <span class="term 57 68 ital">Neru <span class="num">68</span></span> specifically, I was really into. Also a lot of edgy stuff. What do you think kept you engaged with Vocaloid? </p>

          <p class="speaker2"> RY: I guess how flexible it was. At that time, because I was super into anime, I had to like the anime to like the people in them because I knew what context they were in. But with Miku, she was a persona that could be projected onto different worlds. Seeing her in all these different states kept it interesting. Like, maybe I didn’t like this one song and this one way that the artists drew her, but then this other artist could draw her in a different way that I really enjoyed. So there’s just more to grab and cling on to.</p>

          <p class="speaker1"> CW: Was there any space that you really didn’t like? That just wasn’t your taste. </p>

          <p class="speaker2"> RY: I don’t know if there was a space. More specifically, it was the way people tuned Miku—there are certain tunings that I just cannot listen to. And then there’s this one producer <span class="term 53 69 ">Mitchie M <span class="num">69</span></span>  who tuned her to sound like a human. I remember they had these crazy music videos too. Not only the way that Miku was tuned, but the way she was illustrated. You know <span class="term 94 70">V2 Miku, V3, Miku <span class="num">70</span></span> , and the different designs? I just gravitated to some more than the others.</p>

          <p class="speaker1"> CW: What is your favorite part about Vocaloid?</p>

          <p class="speaker2"> RY: The community. I don’t know how much I’m driven by nostalgia when I say this, but going onto old Vocaloid videos and seeing that there’s a group of people who enjoy this—like when I went to <span class="term 51 71 ital">Miku Expo <span class="num">71</span></span> and saw that there were other people banging their heads to this VR projection—it just felt really nice to be there as a prepubescent boy. It was just a nice space to be in. </p>

          <p class="speaker1"> CW: Had you been to any other concerts at the time? Were you into any other sorts of music communities? </p>

          <p class="speaker2"> RY: I think I really liked <span class="term 65 72 ">Porter Robinson <span class="num">72</span></span> , which was Miku adjacent because he uses Vocaloid in some of his songs. When I was into Vocaloid back then, I even downloaded the program and was messing around with it. This is before I learned Japanese, so I was just trying to make her speak English, which then you realize that she can’t. </p>

          <p class="speaker1"> CW: How did you download it? Like pirate it? </p>

          <p class="speaker2"> RY: Was it not free? Honestly, I might have pirated it. But I also downloaded the <span class="term 93 73">UTAUloid <span class="num">73</span></span>  which was free.</p>

          <p class="speaker1"> CW: There’s that one red haired one that’s really popular, <span class="term 40 74">Kasane Teto<span class="num">74</span></span> ? I was never really into that. </p>

          <p class="speaker2"> RY: To me, Teto and Miku felt like rivals. Like the UTATUloids were like “Ew, Vocaloid...” I found Teto through this one music video—this was back when YouTube still had annotations. This was a crazy moment for me, because that specific YouTube video was the first time where I saw <span class="term 102 75 ">annotations <span class="num">75</span></span> that came in so fast that they covered the screen—there were just so many. I remember when they got rid of annotations on YouTube, I was like, “It’s over.”
          <br><br>
          I had no idea that Vocaloid songs on YouTube were always re-uploaded from <span class="term 58 76 ">Niconico <span class="num">76</span></span> . So when I went to Niconico and saw the <span class="term 14 77 ">scrolling comments <span class="num">77</span></span> , I was like, “Oh, I see where it comes in now.” But with UTAUloid, I didn’t realize that there was a separate community to it. To me, it was just kind of one big merged voice-synthesizing community. Like they’re not under Crypton, they have their own software, and it’s free.</p>

      		</div>

					<p class="speaker1"> CW: How about fan-base wise?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: You know <span class="term 56 78 ">Neru [Vocaloid] <span class="num">78</span></span>? There was one song, <span class="term 89 79 ital">&#9835; Triple Baka <span class="num">79</span></span>. She was in that, and so was Teto and Miku. That was like a merging of communities. Yeah, so to me, I was like, “Oh, this is one thing.”</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Did you ever participate in the community yourself? And that could be like anything from just commenting on stuff, or being on forums, to fan art or making music?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Yes. I did comment on youtube videos. I remember one of my comments—it wasn’t on a Miku video, it was on a <span class="term 81 80 ital">Splatoon <span class="num">80</span></span> video. So Splatoon has a similar thing, where they’re also voice synthesizers. So the whole point is Splatoon has idols who are the main MCs for the game. They’re all voice-synthesized, they have their own music, and it’s produced in a pretty similar way. And because of this, it has a similar fandom. Nintendo did these concerts where the idols were singing the songs in the game, in a similar way where there were these holograms being projected—like 3d models. I remember I commented, “oh my god, this is just like Miku” or something like that. And then someone called me a weeb. And I’m like, in middle school, like “how dare you!” </p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Like, that person is also watching a Splatoon video.</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: That’s what I’m saying, like, what are you doing here? But then I remember there’s this one who tuned Vocaloids really well, to the point where they added artificial breaths. </p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Yeah, I think you showed me. What was their name again?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: I don’t remember, but I’m still subscribed to them. I remember I commented on one of the videos and I was like, “Wow, she sounds real! And you can hear her breaths!”—something like that. That was like the top comment for a while, until I stumbled on it again a few years ago and was like, “This is embarrassing,” and then I deleted it.</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Noo!</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: It had like 800 likes—it was at the top. I was like “this is awful.”</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: That is the quintessential experience. </p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Yeah, like old comments resurfacing.</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Did you remember it? Or did you just click on the video again and find it?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: I was going through my subscriber list. And looking at old Vocaloid producers I used to follow.
					<br><br>
					As for how I participated in the community—<span class="term 21 81 ital">Google+ <span class="num">81</span></span>, of course, People would make GIFs of Miku and then like, put a quote on it. I would be like, “Yes, I resonate with this!” And then I would “+1” it or whatever, repost it. So at the same time that I was in this Miku craze, I used to play this game called <span class="term 9 82 ital">Brave Frontier <span class="num">82</span></span>. It was a gacha game.</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Oh this looks really familiar. I think because this rhythm game I played had a collab with it. </p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: I played this game—it was my life. I played on my Samsung tablet or whatever. So during Miku Expo in 2016, they had a collab with this game. Miku was a unit that you could pull for. So it just perfectly lined up with my Miku craze at the time. I was like, “This is crazy!” And they would play hand in hand during her event. I would be reading on wikis and forums like, “How to pull for her, How to get the best stats,” and things like that. </p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Did it come out for the expo?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Yeah, it was like a cross promotional thing. So the expo music would play during the battles. And they included all the other main Vocaloid characters.</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: That’s crazy.</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Because I went to art school, we would have a winter concert and a spring concert at the end of the year. Everyone would sing a finale at the end of the show. There was one Vocaloid song—I don’t remember what it was—but I was like, “We have to sing this as a school.” And I didn’t do this, but I was gonna show my music teacher and be like, “Can we like transpose this, and then we can all sing it?” I stopped myself because I think I got to the point where I was aware that the adults wouldn’t get it and be like, “These are robots singing.” But it got to the point where I was like, “I want us all to sing this.”</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Do you remember the song? Was it in Japanese? </p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: No, it was in English. That’s the thing. And it was all the five or six Vocaloids you just showed singing about singing together. And I was like this would make sense as a choir for saying this. </p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Yeah. Was it like Blessing or Connecting or something?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Yeah, <span class="term 10 83 ital">Connecting <span class="num">83</span></span>.
					<br><br>
					Pulling this up just reminded me—my first exposure to Vocaloid actually was <span class="term 69 84 ital">&#9835; Rolling Girl <span class="num">84</span></span>. But I saw it as a meme. I would think the video was like, “Rolling Girl Compilation.” And it was a grid of like, different video game or anime characters doing the animation. And I was like, what is going on? </p>

      		</div>

					<p class="speaker1">CW: Like, why are they on the ground? </p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: But I didn’t realize it was Vocaloid at the time. But I would think that was my first exposure.</p>

					<h2>The Talent of the Community</h2>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: What drew you to the community?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: The passion that people have for it. So many people are making fan art and producing music. And then they have artists to animate the videos. Yeah, it’s a whole team. And then, sometimes the production team is just one guy. And I’m like, “This is crazy! Like you animated this too?” I honestly feel like it was a defining moment for me as an artist because I was like, “Wow, you can do so much!” Like these people are so passionate, and then the work that they’re making is so polished as well.
					<br><br>
					Let me think what else. There was another song—<span class="term 7 85 ital">&#9835; Ayano's Theory of Happiness <span class="num">85</span></span>. It was part of a story project. </p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Mm, <span class="term 38 86 ital">Kagerou Project <span class="num">86</span></span>!</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Yes. I was like, “Wow, people are actually making plot with these songs that you could just produce yourselves.”</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: And that became so big. It had an anime, it had a light novel series and everything.</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: I never got into it, but just the fact that it was there and that I knew about it—I was like, “This is crazy that people are doing this.” Yeah, I think it’s just the talent.</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Yeah, it’s just crazy to me. Obviously we learn about these songs and these producers through the music, but then it’ll be like, “Oh, this person also animated it.” And I’ll just be like, “Stop, you’re not allowed to have multiple talents.” </p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: I think my defining song was probably <span class="term 68 87 ital">&#9835; Reboot <span class="num">87</span></span>. </p>

      		</div>

					<p class="speaker1">CW: That was the song that got me into Vocaloid!</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Yeah, I know we talked about this before. It was by JimmyThumbP. I remember watching it and I was like, “Whoa, this is like an anime and just like a music video.” </p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Yeah, that one was such high production! I wonder how many people got into Vocaloid through that. Because that was the song that truly got me into it. I was like, “Oh wow, this is legit.”</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Because you would have videos like Reboot where they’re fully modeled or animated, and then even have the kinetic typography kind of videos, which were insane!</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: I know! You don’t know how many times like, even in a graphic design studio crit, I’ll pull one up and make everyone watch it.</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Because also, running adjacently, this was when I was getting into pirating After Effects. So this was the beginning of my motion days, and I remember seeing these videos just like, “Whoa, this is crazy!”</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Yeah. It makes me believe in not needing art school. </p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Yeah. Close yourself off and just make things. </p>

					<h2>The Nostalgia of Miku</h2>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: How would you say Vocaloid has impacted your life? </p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: When I was into Vocaloid in middle school, I was kind of loud and proud about it. Like after I went to the Miku concert, I wore the shirt in school. I even bought Miku posters. Like if you go into my house now, there are two massive Miku posters in my old bedroom. And I even bought a Miku art book, which I think I sent you when I went home over the break. I kept the glow stick and everything. But then I think, near the end of middle school, high school, when puberty was hitting, I like  hid it away. I was like, “I would never like Vocaloid, that’s awful.” But I think right now I’m in a resurgence. I proudly tell people that I went to a Miku concert because I think I’m starting to understand how deeply it has defined me as a person. I remember when we would go on road trips.
					<br><br>I was into Vocaloid and I got my brother into Vocaloid. My brother is three years younger than me. So we were into it at the same time, and we would bond over it. So on road trips, I would ask my parents for the phone so I could play Vocaloid music, and they would get so annoyed, like “We hate this robot voice.” I’d be having the time of my life in the back. But like thinking back now I’m like wow, I’m so sorry to my parents. I’d be playing <span class="term 85 88 ital">&#9835; Disappearance <span class="num">88</span></span>.</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Yeah, they’re like “Why can’t you be normal?” </p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Yeah, like “Why do you listen to a robot?” I think it unconsciously sent me into the realm of being more artistic, I guess. I think it just helped keep a certain passion alive in me. I wasn’t just drawing at the time, but playing cello, piano, things like that. In my art school, we had a music program that we were all in as well. So yeah, I think the music kept the music passion alive too. </p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: What else were you listening to at the time?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Anime openings. I had this MP4 player from China that was a hand-me-down from my grandma. It wasn’t touchscreen but I could put an SD card in and it would play music, and I’d have like 100 songs on there—anime openings, Miku songs etc. </p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: How about now? How has your music taste evolved?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Oh, that’s the other thing. So I used to listen to music by downloading from YouTube. But ever since I got a streaming service in high school, so many Voclaoid songs are region locked to Japan. And then I think because Voclaoid became less accessible to me to listen to, I think my listening dwindled. But whenever Vocaloid pops up, I will gladly listen to it. Like so many of my favorite producers like <span class="term 70 89">ryo (supercell) <span class="num">89</span></span> just don’t have their songs on Spotify. It’s just the live version, which is fine, but I want the raw thing.</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: I didn’t use Spotify until college. I would also download everything, and I had thousands of songs. I had a lot of patience. </p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Back then, yeah. And I would rename them and everything.  But I think another big reason I did that was because back then, when I was into Vocaloid, I was less aware of the producer as a being. It was just like, “Everything is Miku.” So I’d download it and I’d be like, “Look at my Miku album.” But now that we’re on streaming services, of course there’s the “This is Hatsune Miku,” playlist on Spotify, but then everything is classified under the producer themselves, which I think just made it harder to find songs.</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: It’s definitely not Vocaloid-friendly.
					<br><br>
					You said before that for a while, you were a little embarrassed about it. But now you’re more into it again. Why would you say that is? What do you think makes you flaunt it more now?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: That’s interesting. I think this is a big cultural thing as well. Like, you notice how there’s a resurgence of anime? Like it’s cool to watch anime now. But back in high school, I would not tell people. I would zip it. It was embarrassing. Like, Grade 9 to Grade 11, I was like, “No, I don’t watch anime. I watch The Office. And I listen to indie bands on Spotify,” and things like that. </p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: For sure. I feel like it’s a little bit of the Y2K aesthetic coming back as well, like some of the earlier Miku stuff. And you’ve also mentioned nostalgia a few times. How do you think that plays a role? </p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: I think it was a middle school hyper fixation. Life just felt happier, like more innocent. And Miku was with me through it all, haha. So I think now, when I think of it, I think of those times, like endlessly browsing and listening to Vocaloid, and it was just a way to kill time. Yeah.</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Do you still listen often?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Every now and then. I have a Vocaloid playlist on YouTube with music videos I remember. Sometimes I’ll just go down the rabbit hole again and just watch them all.</p>



					<h2>The Darker Side of Vocaloid</h2>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: What/ would you say is your favorite Vocaloid song or producer?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: I have two: I’ll say <span class="term 70 90 ">ryo (supercell) <span class="num">90</span></span> and <span class="term 42 91">kz-livetune <span class="num">91</span></span>. Supercell’s music is just so good. I think one of my favorite Vocaloid songs is probably <span class="term 59 92 ital">&#9835; Odds and Ends <span class="num">92</span></span>.
					<br><br>
					They also had this other song—<span class="term 73 93 ital">&#9835; Sekiranun Grafitti <span class="num">93</span></span>  by <span class="term 70 94 ">ryo (supercell) <span class="num">94</span></span>. I remember talking about this with my brother because we treated this like real lore. And we were like, “Oh my god, Miku has a child.” </p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Oh, she does?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: There’s two Mikus! But it’s also beautifully animated.
					<br><br>
					And then I also like <span class="term 42 95 ">kz-livetune <span class="num">95</span></span> because the 2017 Miku Expo was centered around his song. Yeah, I like all of his songs. His music was super autotuned. Also, they were beautifully animated.
					<br><br>
					I like to think of Vocaloid music like there’s a bright side and a dark side. And I talked about <span class="term 90 96 ital">&#9835; Two-Faced Lovers <span class="num">96</span></span>  earlier—when I listened to it, I thought, “What a great song,” and then the comments were like, “Yeah, this is about teen pregnancy.” As a kid, I was like, “That’s crazy.” </p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: No yeah, I feel like all of <span class="term 100 97 ">wowaka's <span class="num">97</span></span> songs are like that. <span class="term 69 98 ital">&#9835; Rolling Girl <span class="num">98</span></span> too.</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: And then there was another song. Oh my god, <span class="term 37 99 ">Rin <span class="num">99</span></span>  and <span class="term 36 100 ">Len <span class="num">100</span></span> had so many weird songs. It was <span class="term 87 101 ital">&#9835; The Straight-Faced Science Girl <span class="num">101</span></span>. Len has a crush on Rin who’s the science girl. But they use a lot of sex innuendos in there, it’s crazy.</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Oh my God, yeah. I remember it was a thing where Len would always be in these perverted songs. There’s so many. And then Rin’s songs would be full of depression.</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: There’s the one where the music video has the desks everywhere and upside down.</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: <span class="term 44 102 ital">&#9835; Lost One's Weeping <span class="num">102</span></span> by <span class="term 57 103 ">Neru [Producer] <span class="num">103</span></span>. I remember it was super popular and super edgy. Were you more into the brighter songs or the dark songs?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: The bright ones were fine, but I think I was drawn towards the dark ones because I was like “Ooh, edgy.” Like, “Woah, they’re singing about abuse?”</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Why do you think you were drawn to the darker ones?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: I don’t know. But I feel like the topics were intriguing to me. I would read the comments and be like, “Woah, I had no idea it was about this.” Imagine a naive middle schooler stumbling on these more sensitive topics. I guess it felt interesting.</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Like something you hadn’t seen before?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: Yeah, Iike with <span class="term 90 104 ital">&#9835; Two-Faced Lovers <span class="num">104</span></span> about teen pregnancy, she aborted her baby. It was about an abortion. And I was like, “Whoa, this feels weird to listen to.” I think that’s what intrigued me.</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Were there any songs where you remember learning what it was about and that changing how you saw the song?</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: To being super dark?</p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Not even, necessarily. I do feel like it’s sort of a uniquely, international-audience experience to listen to a song... </p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: ...and not understand it. </p>
					<p class="speaker1">CW: Yeah. And then to have reading or understanding the lyrics after the fact change the experience.</p>
					<p class="speaker2">RY: I remember watching—maybe this is more recent—some <span class="term 100 105 ">wowaka <span class="num">105</span></span> videos, and all the comments are like, “Rest in peace” and things like that.
					<br><br>
					I was really into this <span class="term 74 106 ital">&#9835; Self-Harm Colorless <span class="num">106</span></span>. It was just a really sad song. Oh, my God, this is awful. But there’s this one song—<span class="term 84 107 ital">&#9835; Tawagoto Speaker <span class="num">107</span></span> or something. I remember this was during my angsty middle school phase. But the comments were like, “Your words pierced through me,” or whatever. I remember finding an English version of it. And we had a poetry assignment during that time where we had to read poems out loud, and I did the English translation of the song. Looking back, the teacher was probably like, “Woah, this kid is, like, saying something...”
					<br><br>
					Oh, this is another of my other favorites, <span class="term 101 108 ital">&#9835; Y-to-Y <span class="num">108</span></span> by <span class="term 48 109"> Megurine Luka <span class="num">109</span></span>. It’s about a breakup. But then there would be the wholesome ones, like there’s one about her going on a first date or whatever. Things like that.</p>

          <h1>Vocaloid's Uncertain Future</h1>
          <sub> A Conversation with Ash Ma and Nor Wu </sub>
					<span style="width: 0px; height: 468px; display: block"></span>

      		<p class="speaker4"> Ash Ma: I feel like we probably have a very different impression of Miku compared to how I feel like you have.</p>
      		<p class="speaker3"> Christine Wang: Well, what’s your impression, I’m curious?</p>
          <p class="speaker5"> Nor Wu: An instrument.</p>
          <p class="speaker3"> CW: Do you guys use Miku to make music?</p>
      		<p class="speaker5"> NW: No, it costs a lot. It’s very very expensive.</p>
          <p class="speaker4"> AM: I feel like at the beginning of the year, it was not that expensive. It was more accessible and developed for people who can’t do vocals.</p>
          <p class="speaker3"> CW: But now it’s more popular?</p>
      		<p class="speaker5"> NW: They also released a more advanced version.</p>
          <p class="speaker4"> AM: Because I feel like my impression is that Miku is not the first Vocaloid-like thing. I got in touch with Vocaloid from that project composed by <span class="term 33 110 ">Jin <span class="num">110</span></span> ... </p>
          <p class="speaker3"> CW: <span class="term 38 111 ital">Kagerou Project <span class="num">111</span></span>? </p>

      		<p class="speaker4"> AM: And most of those were with <span class="term 30 112 ">IA <span class="num">112</span></span>. </p>
          <p class="speaker3"> CW: That was also what got me into Vocaloid. </p>
          <p class="speaker4"> AM: Because Miku is kind of everywhere. She’s kind of like a label that marks a preference—some people prefer using Miku as their voice bank. There’s also so many versions of Miku, so it’s kind of flowing all around.</p>
      		<p class="speaker3"> CW: Yeah I know some people will use a specific version of Miku as how they tune, and you can tell.</p>
          <p class="speaker5"> NW: For me, I think the first time I encountered Miku, I really really like the <span class="term 97 113 ">Vocaloid-P <span class="num">113</span></span>  <span class="term 57 114 ">Neru <span class="num">114</span></span>. </p>
          <p class="speaker3"> CW: I love Neru. Probably one of my favorite producers. There’s him and <span class="term 60 115 ">Orangestar <span class="num">115</span></span>.</p>
          <p class="speaker4"> AM: So Miku was kind of like a byproduct that always came with the songs. </p>
          <p class="speaker3"> CW: So you were more interested in the music first, and it just happened to be made by Vocaloid?</p>
          <p class="speaker4"> AM: Yeah, but then, Miku exploded into an icon. </p>
          <p class="speaker5"> NW: Yeah, like the producers give Miku character. Originally, she is an inorganic figure, but she turns into something organic.</p>
          <p class="speaker3"> CW: I’m really interested in what people’s indiv experiences are with Miku. I feel like there’s also a unique experience from an international community. I know you guys are sort of in-between that—you guys both know Japanese. </p>
          <p class="speaker5"> NW: I feel like my Japanese speaking is better than my English. </p>

					<h2>Growing up with Vocaloid</h2>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: How did you discover Vocaloid?</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: There’s a website called bilibili.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Kind of like a plagiarized <span class="term 58 116">Niconico <span class="num">116</span></span>.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I think in my primary school age, it was a popular website.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: How old were you around then?</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Sixth grade? So 11, 12. </p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Maybe 10, because I went to school a bit earlier. Bilibili at the time had a major focus on ACG culture. There were a lot of people reposting Vocaloid. I remember the projects just popped up on my homepage.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: In my primary school, <span class="term 2 117">ACG (anime, comics, games) <span class="num">117</span></span> culture was kind of mainstream, like it was what we talked about. I was influenced by my classmates talking about it a lot.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: Where did you two go to school for primary school?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: We were both in the south of China. But my situation is a very different case.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I think my case is more rare.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: No, I think it’s half-and-half probably. At first, with the internet in China, we didn’t have any limitations on accessing anything like we do right now. Also, copyright was not actually the thing. More things were just freely accessible. ACG was quite popular and took part with quite a lot of the younger generation.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: So, do you think that’s no longer true because the internet has changed?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: I think it’s still true, but I think the whole culture kind of shifted. I think what it used to be was a rare form—it was just rising. It was not a major thing that could be seen by major audiences. Because in my case, the reason why I got so much time on the internet was because I didn’t have any friends. Like. I was so introverted and isolated in primary school until high school. That’s the time where I think 80% of my time was on the internet.
					<br><br>
					There were small groups of people on social media like Tieba, QQ, where you can post your artwork or your interests in whatever specific groups you were interested in. Then, you can be like, “Please repost,” so you will find more people who have the same interests as you. I spent a lot of time on that. So my whole community was actually online.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: That seems like a sort of common experience with a lot of fans of Vocaloid.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I had a very different experience. I was very extroverted during primary school. So me and my friend talked about ACG a lot. We were both very interested in Boy’s Love. We were very interested in Naruto and One Piece at the time. Do you know <span class="term 52 118">MMD (Miku Miku Dance) <span class="num">118</span></span>? We would browse for MMDs for so much time. MMDs are usually linked to Vocaloid songs, so my interests kind of shifted to Vocaloid after that. I was also interested in—do you know <span class="term 92 119 ital">utattemita <span class="num">119</span></span>?</p>

      			</div>
      		</div>

					<p class="speaker3">CW: That was what I was mainly interested in actually.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: At the time, there was a guy called <span class="term 45 120">Mafumafu <span class="num">120</span></span>. I really hate him right now, but I used to be a big fan. Actually, my friend bought me a CD for my birthday called <span class="term 3 121">After the Rain <span class="num">121</span></span>.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: Oh yeah, with Soraru.
					<br><br>
					So were you exposed to that alongside your exposure to Vocaloid, then?</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Yeah.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: And when you discovered the MMDs, you were interested in the dancing first and the animation?</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I think I was interested in both. Because the songs really attracted my attention, I just wanted to search more about the song, and I discovered amazing <span class="term 97 122 ">Vocaloid-P <span class="num">122</span></span> like <span class="term 57 123 ">Neru <span class="num">123</span></span>.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Especially Neru’s early songs are so impressive.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I think the storytelling is very, very good. I think if you’re experiencing school and the environment in Japan—it’s very similar to our experience in China. It’s very relatable.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: And also Neru partnered with <span class="term 77 124 ">Shidu <span class="num">124</span></span>, who was the PV maker. They made a lot of really narrative driven music videos. I feel like the music video is actually a very, very important part of Vocaloid.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I agree.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: I really love Neru’s music videos.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Yeah, so Shidu made most of them. They became really famous for PV making, because they are actually setting all the characters. They basically did everything in the music video, including all like character settings, animations, and all that was included in the MV.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Oh, so the movie was also made by Shidu?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Yeah.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: That’s crazy.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: <span class="term 38 125 ital">Kagerou Project <span class="num">125</span></span> was also drawn by Shidu. Shidu also made all the characters settings.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: What do you mean by character setting?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Like character designs, because Kagerou Project has a lot of people. It’s a project starting from individuals, where <span class="term 33 126 ">Jin <span class="num">126</span></span> posted a character song, and then the character song leads to another character song. So I think in 2012 or 13, this was a really popular trend for these projects.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: I only know of Kagerou Project. Were there other ones?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: There was also a project called <span class="term 43 127 ital">Last Note <span class="num">127</span></span>, by <span class="term 82 128 ">Suzumu <span class="num">128</span></span>. I bought the CD for that too. It’s a very similar project to Kagerou Project.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Is that the guy who had a lot of drama with <span class="term 45 129 ">Mafumafu <span class="num">129</span></span>?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Yes.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: Oh my god.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Yeah, I think they released maybe five or four character songs, but the project terminated because of the drama between Suzumu and Mafumafu. I think who was saying who plagiarized... </p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Mafumafu said Suzumu plagiarized.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: That’s crazy. So there was actually quite a lot of drama between these <span class="term 97 130 ">Vocaloid-P <span class="num">130</span></span>.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I also like <span class="term 19 131 ">Giga <span class="num">131</span></span>. I think my graphic design started with Giga’s PVs.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: Really? How so?</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Because these mainly focus on typography.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: I was always very impressed by the typography inside the MVs. That’s definitely where my interest in motion at least started from.
					<br><br>
					Do you guys remember when you first discovered Vocaloid? What was your initial impression?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: I think I was very not used to it. I think the first video I ever click was also <span class="term 92 132 ital">utattemita <span class="num">132</span></span>, and then I traced back to the original Vocaloid. The voice sounded so weird to me. I was really drawn to like the PV because I remember the first song I’ve ever heard—it was <span class="term 38 133 ital">Kagerou Project's <span class="num">133</span></span> <span class="term 7 134 ital">&#9835; Ayano's Theory of Happiness <span class="num">134</span></span>. I was so obsessed with Ayano. So I think that was also causing me to create my own fanart. I was really drawn by the whole PV; it was just so moving.
					<br><br>
					But I was not used to the voice at first. I was listening to versions of utattemita, but not Vocaloid. But then, I don’t know where the turning point was, but from one day onward, I just listened to Vocaloid more and more. And yeah, I can’t listen to any utattemita anymore.</p>

      			</div>
      		</div>

					<p class="speaker3">CW: Yeah, I’m honestly the same way. The friend who introduced me to Vocaloid was really really obsessed with the <span class="term 7 135 ital">&#9835; Ayano <span class="num">135</span></span> song—they learned to play it on the piano and everything. But the reason I was so into utattemita in high school was also because I was a bit off-put by the Vocaloid robotic-ness. Also, I just liked some of the stylistic flares that some utaites added when they sang. But that for me was more like 2016, 2017—it was a bit later. And now, most of the utaite I like don’t really sing anymore. There’s new ones; obviously, they come and go, but I feel like the era that I was really interested in has sort of passed, and they’ve all sort of moved on to their own careers.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I liked Rib. And <span class="term 1 136 ">96Neko <span class="num">136</span></span>.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: <span class="term 1 137">96Neko <span class="num">137</span></span> is a <span class="term 98 138">VTuber <span class="num">138</span></span> right now. They have a rap project similar to <span class="term 28 139 ital">HypMic (Hypnosis Mic) <span class="num">139</span></span>. There’s also like a yellow-haired guy... it’s Amatsuki, 96Neko, and one other guy.
					<br><br>
					It’s really interesting because all of these fan cultures blended together. They’re all connected. VTuber’s now also release a lot of utattemita. But I feel like now there’s two separate groups—one is more of a commercial side of Vocaloid. So when songs release, I think companies (like <span class="term 12 140">Crypton <span class="num">140</span></span>) will actually hire people to make songs.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: Yeah, that’s what I’ve noticed as well. And that was one of the reasons I think I became less interested in Vocaloid. I was definitely most interested in Vocaloid around 2016, but that was around when a lot of interest declined, I think. At least internationally. And it feels like since then, the new songs that have been coming out are mostly commercial works.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Yeah, but there’s still new Vocaloid songs posted, some pretty good songs, on <span class="term 58 141">Niconico <span class="num">141</span></span>.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: And I think most people don’t use Vocaloid anymore. They use <span class="term 93 142 ">UTAU <span class="num">142</span></span>.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: Really? Why is that?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Because Vocaloid is so expensive.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I think the mainstream right now is <span class="term 40 143 ">Kasane Teto <span class="num">143</span></span>.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: I feel like now people don’t really use Miku that much.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Also UTAU is all free. And you can make UTAU with your own voice pretty easily. So I think the people who like experimental works like me are more inclined to use UTAU instead of Miku or Vocaloid.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Yeah, I feel like now, if you use Miku, it’s either you’re so obsessed with Miku herself. Or it’s just more of like... </p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: ...your IP, it’s a part of your IP.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: I think it’s also kind of like a symbol of a professional Vocaloid.</p>


					<h2>The Commercialization of Vocaloid and the Fall of Miku</h2>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: So now, like you mentioned, there’s those two spheres. There’s the commercial or professional, and the more underground community.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Yeah, because I feel like, even back to 2015 or 16, people are still finding a way of like, can I just make songs as my career using Vocaloid? And that was a period where people were just trying different ways of doing it. I think the company itself was not really involved.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: They just sort of let everyone make their own songs.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Yeah. But then corporations started to come in, and the whole pattern just came in. I think right now, Vocaloid has a really mature commercial system.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: Yeah, there’s so many collaborations. I’m sure you know the <span class="term 103 144 ">Pokémon one <span class="num">144</span></span>?</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Yeah. I just hate the songs.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: Yeah, I think they’re so bad.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: So bad.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: I’m not on Niconico, but I could just tell things were becoming more commercial from the songs that were being released—like before <span class="ital">Project Voltage</span>, even. I used to follow <span class="term 15 145 ">DECO*27 <span class="num">145</span></span> a lot.</p>

					<div class="imgContainer">
      			<img src="assets/projectvoltage_1.jpg" class="imgFormat">
      			<div class="imgCaption">Still from Volt Tackle by DECO*27, one of the songs included in the Project Voltage series. </div>
      		</div>

					<p class="speaker4">AM: Ahhhh.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Ahhhh.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: I was really into their Ghost album—songs like <span class="term 18 146 ital">&#9835; Ghost Rule <span class="num">146</span></span>. And then, I feel like everything after that... </p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: ...was trash.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: Like it just sounded so... corporate?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: I feel it would be interesting if you did some case study for specific <span class="term 97 147 ">Vocaloid-Ps <span class="num">147</span></span>. Especially if they started to make songs really early on, and how they’ve changed. Yeah, because I know <span class="term 23 148 ">hachi <span class="num">148</span></span>—there’s like people who start from Vocaloid and then end up as professional singers, like hachi.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I think he also started a pattern because he is so successful as a musician. After he quit Vocaloid, so many <span class="ital">Vocaloid-P</span> tried to become singers.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Also <span class="term 8 149 ">Ayase <span class="num">149</span></span>, the person who writes songs for Yoasobi, used to make Vocaloid songs. There’s just so many people like that. So I think right now, Vocaloid is for if you have this huge goal of being a professional artist. Some people start with Vocaloid and know how to build their own IP, because you just partner with a very good artist and make a really complete project.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Like <span class="term 17 150 ">Eve <span class="num">150</span></span>—his MVs are all like independent animations.
					<p class="speaker4">AM: I think he got rich after he got big with <span class="term 35 151 ital">Jujutsu Kaisen <span class="num">151</span></span>, and now he’s just throwing away money.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: The first time he released a Vocaloid PV, he actually made the animation by himself. So, he wrote the lyrics, he wrote the song, and he made the animation. But he was very rich from start because he has a very powerful dad. So he built his own studio after he got famous.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: Money really helps.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Also, <span class="term 62 152">Pinnochio-P <span class="num">152</span></span>? He makes his own MV as well.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: Yeah, I heard that as well. He’s another one whom I feel like his music changed a lot.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I think a <span class="ital">Vocaloid-P</span> who is very well balanced between commercial work and their own songs is <span class="term 72 153">sasakure.UK <span class="num">153</span></span>.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: He wrote a lot of commissioned songs for <span class="term 66 154 ital">Project Sekai <span class="num">154</span></span>. The highest level songs, like the most difficult songs, are composed by him. But they’re more instrumental.
					<br><br>
					He kind of came from the rhythm game perspective. I think he wrote a lot of songs for those rhythm games from other platforms, and then kind of diverged into Vocaloid.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I feel like he was like a musician at first and then shifted to Vocaloid.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: So for people like <span class="term 19 155">Giga <span class="num">155</span></span>, who I know you said you really enjoy—you’re a big fan of him, but you don’t like his new stuff?</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I feel like I am ok with Giga’s new stuff. But for <span class="term 15 156 ">DECO*27 <span class="num">156</span></span> or <span class="term 41 157">Kikuo <span class="num">157</span></span>, they shifted a lot, became more and more commercial.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: I don’t think Kikuo is that commercial though.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: I don’t know any of their newer stuff.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Kikuo had a really interesting career journey. He made a video of what happened for his full career. I think both of these <span class="term 97 158 ">Vocaloid-P <span class="num">158</span></span> have a really interesting career, because you can see how the whole market and community have shifted and impacted their songs directly.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: And that shift, you think, is the commercial part?</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I think it’s how Vocaloid became mainstream.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: There’s also more new forms of those fans of <span class="term 2 159 ">ACG <span class="num">159</span></span> culture like <span class="term 98 160 ">VTubers <span class="num">160</span></span>, right? Before VTubers, we came into a streaming era. I think people started to embed Vocaloid into more forms of activities. There were more offline activities for Vocaloid—concerts, DJ events. They also launched <span class="term 66 161 ital">Project Sekai <span class="num">161</span></span>.</p>

					<div class="imgContainer">
      			<img src="assets/projectsekai_2.jpg" class="imgFormat">
      			<div class="imgCaption">Splash art for Project Sekai: Colorful Stage. </div>
      		</div>

					<p class="speaker3">CW: Do you feel like that has a different community?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: I know people are so mad at this game. Those “true” Vocaloid fans are very mad.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Because the focus is not on Vocaloid, actually, but the characters in the game.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: I feel like people want to play <span class="ital">Project Sekai</span> because it’s this official thing. You get to play all the songs you have listened to so much. And some people are really into the Vocaloid characters like Miku, Len, Meiko, Kaito, etc. So they were excited because you are creating stories for these people; you’re making them into lively characters. But then in <span class="ital">Project Sekai</span>, the focus of all this character development is actually not in the Vocaloid—it’s the other characters. The band members.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Also I feel like it’s weird to give a character to Hatsune Miku or Rin and Len.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: There’s actually different versions of Miku in <span class="ital">Project Sekai</span>.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: I guess they have to.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: They have happy Miku and depressed Miku.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: It’s kind of based on genre.
					<br><br>
					I remember for Miku, there are like different seasons of Miku—winter, spring. Also, Vocaloid will recruit designers for those versions. There’s a competition.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: Yeah, I’ve seen that. There still is, right?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: And they also just partner with good illustrators. Actually, I feel like the influence of Miku brought up those really famous illustrators on Chinese social media.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I feel like people who are interested in Hatsune Miku or virtual stuff—when they grow up, that actually influences the market.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: How so?</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Because Hatsune Miku or virtual Vocaloid characters are, for our generation, a new thing. So it takes time for us to accept that into our life. But there’s time between when it became a market and when it was first invented. I feel like I’ve heard people growing up and having the financial ability to purchase things and promote stuff. I feel like that influences the market and how people perceive this thing.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Yeah, I think there’s more people. I feel before that the market for Vocaloid, or even just <span class="term 2 162">ACG <span class="num">162</span></span> culture in general, was just a small percentage. The forms of media we consumed were also kind of limited because they were either music videos, comics, or <span class="term 5 163">anime <span class="num">163</span></span>. That was pretty much it. But now I feel like it’s shifted to like, “Oh, when we create comics, it could become animations and become a movie, and we can make goods around all these things. So we can make this project at a bigger scale and make more money.” My Japanese friends are telling me now that for <span class="term 78 164 ital">Shounen Jump <span class="num">164</span></span>, when creators pitch their ideas for a new <span class="term 47 165">manga <span class="num">165</span></span>, the editor will consider whether it’s possible to animate. So that’s a really important condition of whether this could be published as a long term thing.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: And that wasn’t true before?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: I feel like back in the day, comics were profitable enough in and of itself. Because people bought a lot of manga. But now, people will only watch anime and then buy all the related merch, so people don’t really buy manga. I think because of how main media consumption shifted from paperback things to more of a virtual space, and that also grew Vocaloid to a much bigger scale. Vocaloid also partnered with all these kinds of animations and games. So since its rise, we are shifted to virtual space even more, and everything’s just bound together.
					<br><br>
					I feel like this at least on the major publications like <span class="ital">Shounen Jump</span>. Because they will literally just make any comics published on <span class="ital">Shounen Jump</span> into an anime.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: It’s a very bad system.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: That’s why they suck. But also, people like it.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: Oh, really?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Like, people like <span class="term 35 166 ital">Jujutsu Kaisen <span class="num">166</span></span>.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: <span class="ital">Jujutsu Kaisen</span> is so popular here.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I was a big fan. I actually made a bunch of fan art. But after the author got popular, he kind of wanted to quit with manga. But I think <span class="ital">Shounen Jump</span> forced him to continue to draw.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: Are you saying a similar thing is happening with Vocaloid?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: I feel like if you want to earn money, if you want to make it your career, then you have to partner with a whole team. It’s no longer like an individual thing </p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I think that’s the commercial part.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Yeah, that’s like the Vocaloid part—UTAU is a different thing.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: So it almost feels like instead of Vocaloid having a commercial and non-commercial part, Vocaloid is commercial and UTAU is more of what Vocaloid used to be.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Yeah, I feel like that’s similar. That’s just what we felt, I guess.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I also have a theory that people who draw Miku fanart, especially Western fanart, is because of a sense of nostalgia. I really like the era where people put a lot of time into the artworks instead of this commercial stuff.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: I agree. I do feel like most of the people I know that are big fans of Miku don’t really listen to much of the new music. They just re-listen to old music, and they’re big fans of that. But that might also be because, here and in the West in general, we’re quite separated from what’s going on. So I feel like if anything, we’re always a few years behind, you know?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Yeah, I think that’s probably true. Because, even though <span class="term 58 167 ital">Niconico <span class="num">167</span></span> is no longer as active of a website—like their scale is definitely not comparable to youtube anymore—people are still concerned with <span class="term 96 168"><span class="ital">dendou</span> (Vocaloid Hall of Fame) <span class="num">168</span></span>. So when the stream number exceeds a certain number, it’s like being praised as a classic.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: For Niconico, there’s an app called Vocacolle where you can just play songs. You can see the ranking here. I think Japanese people are really into this ranking.</p>


					<h2>Becoming Artists through Digital Culture</h2>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: I had some questions as well about the community. How did you guys personally participate in it?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: I was really involved in Tieba—I signed into that Tieba thing every day. And then I had a post where I updated all of my fanart into that post, which is cringy. I didn’t really have any sense of shame at the time. I would just like, ask random people if they’re interested in what I’m interested in and try to make friends that way.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: I think a lot of us have that experience growing up, honestly. Like, we look back and we think it’s embarrassing, but it’s pretty common.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Yeah. I made a lot of fan art for <span class="term 38 169 ital">Kagerou <span class="num">169</span></span>. I spent so much time on it, like I spent my entire primary and secondary time on that project. I would draw paper fanart. At first, I just tried to copy the character designs, like the illustrations <span class="term 77 170 ">Shidu <span class="num">170</span></span> did for the MV. Then, I tried to make something I imagined that character would do. I was also very into a couple in Kagerou Project. It was Kano and Kido, because I was very into the Kano character song, which was cringe but good.
					<br><br>
					An interesting thing about Kagerou Project is that the secondary MVs are really good. For Kano’s music video, there were secondary MVs that would trace the original but change Kano to another character. So someone would put <span class="term 13 171 ital">Danganronpa's <span class="num">171</span></span> Nagito onto that music video. I thought that music also fit their character so well. That was also a thing I was really obsessed with at the time.</p>

      			</div>
      		</div>


					<p class="speaker4">I feel like because Vocaloid was such a fan-driven thing, people were also interested in other <span class="term 5 172 ">anime <span class="num">172</span></span> or <span class="term 47 173">manga <span class="num">173</span></span>, so people would impose that character into existing MVs. Because you don’t need to rethink everything—you can just retrace and change something on top.</p>

					<p class="speaker3">CW: How would you say Vocaloid has impacted your life?</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: I feel like, definitely, my whole aesthetic was influenced by Vocaloid. It was the first entrance for me to the world of visualizing narratives and how things could be interesting to look at. It’s very different from painting or the traditional media we have seen in the gallery. It brought me a huge new set of art or design in my life. It’s also really cool to learn how I researched things. When I was really interested in a Vocaloid song, I would literally search for all the people involved in making that song. And I would listen to every song the producer made and find his posts on social media. So that got me into the whole internet “digging” process.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: You learned how to use the internet.</p>
					<p class="speaker4">AM: Yeah. I think Vocaloid is something that provided me with this whole passion for seeing interesting things and wanting to know who made this stuff and how they made it. That also shaped a lot of how I look at things. Because I appreciate some of the more curated studies of art and design. But I also enjoy a lot of things that were just so not official, so not curated.</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: I think I have a nearly identical experience to that. I feel like I’m more influenced by Vocaloid and Japanese culture than fine art. I think it definitely shaped how I view art and how I view the world, even.</p>
					<p class="speaker3">CW: How so?</p>
					<p class="speaker5">NW: It was like a weird thing, because I was in China before I went to college. The first time I brought <span class="term 5 174 ">anime <span class="num">174</span></span> or similar ideas into college, especially as a freshmen, was the first time I found out that Western academia is not accepting of these things. I feel like there’s a totally different pixel art style for Vocaloid on <span class="term 63 175 ">pixiv <span class="num">175</span></span>. It’s very avant-garde. The community is actually of painting students in Japan, but they are very interested in Vocaloid and digital things. I feel like I relate to this kind of stuff more.</p>
