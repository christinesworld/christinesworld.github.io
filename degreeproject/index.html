        <div class= "landingText"> Within twenty-four hours of landing in Tokyo for the first time, I took the bullet train some 200+ miles west to Osaka to celebrate <span class="term 1">Hatsune Miku</span>’s sixteenth birthday. I watched from the far back corner of a warehouse amongst thousands of people as a life-sized hologram of a teal-haired teenage girl materialized onto stage. For the next few hours, this hologram sang and danced to a live band as fans cheered and waved colored light sticks in unison. Although it was <span class="term 1">Hatsune Miku</span>’s sixteenth birthday, she had actually been sixteen for the past sixteen years and would continue to be sixteen for the rest of eternity. Miku was created in 2007 by <span class="term 2">Crypton Future Media Inc.</span> as a <span class="term 3">Vocaloid</span>, a digital synthesizer software that allows users to create artificial singing voices. <span class="term 1">Miku</span> is the twin-tailed virtual idol representing a voice bank provided by actress Saki Fujita. Her age—sixteen years old—is one of only six parameters officially specified about her. The remainder of her character, including her background, personality, and motivations, is entirely up to fans to decide. <span class="term 1">Miku</span> has over 100,000 songs and 1,000,000 artworks born out of a vibrant participatory community of fan creators. Despite this, the vast majority of fans do not make any money from their creations while Miku herself generates millions in revenue. This is possible due to <span class="term 2">Crypton</span>’s custom PiaPro copyright laws which allow free usage of <span class="term 1">Miku</span>’s character as long as the user does not profit from it. These policies enable <span class="term 2">Crypton</span> to use <span class="term 1">Miku</span> to secure corporate partnerships with companies like Dominoes Pizza, Toyota, and Google while outsourcing the labor of developing her image to <span class="term 1">Miku</span>’s fanbase. </div>

          <p> Within twenty-four hours of landing in Tokyo for the first time, I took the bullet train some 200+ miles west to Osaka to celebrate <span class="term 1">Hatsune Miku</span>’s sixteenth birthday. I watched from the far back corner of a warehouse amongst thousands of people as a life-sized hologram of a teal-haired teenage girl materialized onto stage. For the next few hours, this hologram sang and danced to a live band as fans cheered and waved colored light sticks in unison. Although it was <span class="term 1">Hatsune Miku</span>’s sixteenth birthday, she had actually been sixteen for the past sixteen years and would continue to be sixteen for the rest of eternity. Miku was created in 2007 by <span class="term 2">Crypton Future Media Inc.</span> as a <span class="term 3">Vocaloid</span>, a digital synthesizer software that allows users to create artificial singing voices. <span class="term 1">Miku</span> is the twin-tailed virtual idol representing a voice bank provided by actress Saki Fujita.

          <br><br>
          <p> Yet, many fans continue to engage with <span class="term 1">Miku</span> despite this exploitation. Stina Marie Hasse Jørgensen, assistant professor at the IT University of Copenhagen, proposes that just participating in the community is enough for fans who are “awarded accordingly with entertainment and online recognition, as well as having their fan-based desires met by an ever-changing, continually updated idol.” While this may explain <span class="term 1">Miku</span>’s large fanbase, it leaves questions as to why fans choose to engage with <span class="term 1">Miku</span> rather than with other media-centered fanbases for anime characters or real-life idols. By interrogating <span class="term 1">Miku</span> beyond her commodity aesthetics, one can begin to understand how she provides strategies to subvert hierarchies of control. Although inevitably subject to the commercial interests of the music industry, Vocaloid’s crowd-sourced foundation offers channels of resistance by allowing community members to elaborate their own desires through digital idols like <span class="term 1">Miku</span>. This engenders <span class="term 1">Miku</span> with fluid signifiers that transcend traditional boundaries of the body, allowing fans to disrupt their relationship to productive consumption through the posthuman affordances of the virtual. </p>
